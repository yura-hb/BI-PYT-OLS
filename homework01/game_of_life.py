# Homework 01 - Game of life
# 
# Your task is to implement part of the cell automata called
# Game of life. The automata is a 2D simulation where each cell
# on the grid is either dead or alive.
# 
# State of each cell is updated in every iteration based state of neighbouring cells.
# Cell neighbours are cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
#
# Rules for update are as follows:
# 
# 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
#
# 
# Our implementation will use coordinate system will use grid coordinates starting from (0, 0) - upper left corner.
# The first coordinate is row and second is column.
# 
# Do not use wrap around (toroid) when reaching edge of the board.
# 
# For more details about Game of Life, see Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

   # TODO: Implement update rules 
   # Should return set of coordinates of alive cells
   # after iter_n iterations.
